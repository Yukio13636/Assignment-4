<h1>Central Kyoto History</h1>
<div class="p1">
<p>Kyoto was first settled in the 7th century and in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital of Japan from nearby Nagaoka-kyo to Kyoto, which at the time was called “Heian-kyo” and was built as a scale replica of the then capital of the Tang empire, Chang’an (modern day Xian). The subsequent Heian period (794-1185) saw Japanese culture blossom in the realms of poetry, architecture, art, and religion.</p>

<p>The Heian period also saw the rise of the samurai class, which eventually established rule in Kamakura, beginning the Kamakura period (1185-1333). This period saw the birth of various Buddhist sects and consequent construction of many of Kyoto’s famous temples, such as Kenninji, Chioin, and Nishi-Honganji. Kyoto witnessed a further cultural renaissance at the beginning of the Muromachi period (1333-1573), characterized by the birth of ikebana, the tea ceremony, the Golden Pavilion and more. Unfortunately, this was followed by the Onin war (1467–1477), where battles between samurai factions on the streets of Kyoto resulted in widespread destruction of the city.</p>
